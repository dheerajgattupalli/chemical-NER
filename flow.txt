Work flow:

1) Consider the max n gram from the given words in the csv file.

2) Generate words from the input patent upto 1 to n-grams

3) Generate the features for each word in this list of 1 to n-grams.

4) Give the features as the input to the CRF model along with the binary output of whether it is a chemical or not chemical based on the words given in the csv file. 

5) Now do the same pre processing part for the test input patent as well and collect all the 1 to n-grams.

6) And from the above model file we can decide whether this particular n-gram is a chemical entity or not.
